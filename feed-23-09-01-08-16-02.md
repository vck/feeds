# computing is interesting again!

crunching numbers through electrons that running over fried sands is cool.
now, humans are already using photons that running through fiber-optic like
"wires" that sends signals/logic/numbers. which is cool.

analog computing becomes cool again, too.
mythic.ai is currently on it.

way to go, humans!
